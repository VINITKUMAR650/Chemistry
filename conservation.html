        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          This is an easy solution to droughts and can be employed with ease at
          home. With rainwater harvesting, homes can store the water they get
          from rain and then use it when they need it in dry conditions, rather
          than exhausting present water bodies like rivers. If a house has a
          primary water source, then rainwater harvesting provides them with an
          auxiliary option that they can use when water is not available.

          2. Planting more trees and Combating Deforestation
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          This is something that needs to be employed by everyone in the world
          and can result in billions of trees planted daily. It is a piece of
          old-age advice but still applies today. Planting more trees will
          improve the quality of the environment and increase the success of
          precipitation.It can also reverse the drought and arid conditions of
          an area if the trees are maintained well until maturity. With planting
          more trees, the other solution is to avoid the existing ones, unless
          more are planted. For instance, the Amazon in South America is being
          destroyed at alarming rates, and scientists have warned that decades
          of human activity and a changing climate will bring the jungle near a
          “tipping point.” The deforestation coupled with forest fires and
          global temperature rises will soon result in the water cycle being
          irreversibly broken and locking in a trend of declining rainfall and
          longer dry seasons that began decades ago.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          We have, for long, relied on non-renewable sources for our energy,
          like petroleum. The extraction and use of these energies results in
          more greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere, resulting in
          global warming and, of course, droughts.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Water is most commonly pumped out of the earth to irrigate crops or
          supply livestock with water. Pumps do, however, use electricity, which
          uses more fossil fuels overall.
          <br />

          Because they don’t consume electricity from the mains to pump water
          for irrigation, solar pumps are becoming more and more common.<br />
          The advantages of solar pumps are being recognized by governments
          worldwide, and some have even provided subsidies to farmers so they
          may install them affordably.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          These can be used at the local, national, regional and international
          levels. Stringent laws need to be implemented on those who use
          practices that can cause droughts or other environmentally damaging
          results.<br /><br />Doing this will stop climate change and solve the
          ongoing droughts. They include limiting the amounts of greenhouse
          gases being pumped into the atmosphere and higher taxes for
          non-compliance.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          This includes educating the younger generation on the need to protect,
          preserve and improve the environment, recycling, reusing and planting
          more trees.<br /><br />

          The education curriculum, the news media and companies also need to
          stress the need to care for the environment, so that it becomes an
          individual task to prevent droughts.
