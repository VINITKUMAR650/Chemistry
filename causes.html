        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Some droughts have occurred naturally, plaguing humankind throughout
          much of our history. Until recently, naturally occurring droughts were
          often natural phenomena triggered by cyclical weather patterns, such
          as the amount of moisture and heat in the air, land, and sea.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The distribution of rainfall around the world can also be affected by
          how air circulates through the atmosphere. When there is an anomaly in
          surface temperatures, particularly over the sea, air circulation
          patterns are altered. This changes how and where precipitation falls
          around the world and the new weather patterns will most likely throw
          water supply and demand out of sync, as is the case when
          earlier-than-usual snowmelt reduces the amount of water available for
          crops in the summer.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">3. Excess Water Demands</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Drought can also result because of an imbalance in the supply and
          demand of water. As the global human population continues to balloon
          and intensive agricultural practices continue to be employed, more
          water is required to sustain the human race as well as the
          agricultural practices. This continues to tip the scales, making
          droughts a reality with each passing day. A study estimated that
          between 1960 and 2010, the human consumption of water increased the
          frequency of drought in North America by 25%. The situation is
          worsened by dwindling rainfalls, forcing people to pump more water
          from rivers, aquifers and reservoirs. Doing this depletes valuable
          water resources that could take years to replenish and could
          permanently impact future water availability. At the same time, demand
          for water supplied by upstream lakes and rivers, particularly in the
          form of irrigation and hydroelectric dams, leads to the diminishing or
          drying out of downstream water sources, further contributing to
          droughts in other regions

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">4. Deforestation and Soil Degradation</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Trees and plants are important as they release moisture to the
          atmosphere, resulting in clouds forming and rainfall falling,
          returning the moisture to the ground. Unfortunately, the human race is
          the best at destroying these natural resources. When forests and
          vegetation disappear, less water is available to feed the water cycle,
          making entire regions more vulnerable to drought. Meanwhile,
          deforestation and other poor land-use practices, like intensive
          farming, continue to diminish soil quality and reduce the landâ€™s
          ability to absorb and retain water. As a result, soil dries out
          faster, inducing agricultural droughts, and less groundwater is
          replenished, contributing to hydrological drought.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          As the name suggests, the planet is being warmed at alarming rates and
          could cause droughts. Global warming is mostly associated with human
          activity such as releasing greenhouse gases which cause a trapping
          effect, causing global temperatures to rise.<br />
          With increased temperatures, water from rivers, streams, lakes and
          other bodies of water will continue to evaporate and other practices
          will result in less of it coming back down as rain. This will
          therefore result in less rainfall and, of course, droughts.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Rising temperatures have the effect of making wet regions wetter and
          dry regions drier. For wetter regions, warm air will absorb more
          water, leading to larger rain events, while in more arid regions,
          warmer temperatures mean water evaporates more quickly. Climate change
          also alters large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, causing a
          shift in storm tracks off their typical paths. This, in turn,
          magnifies weather extremes, which is one reason why climate models
          predict the already parched U.S. Southwest and the Mediterranean will
          continue to get drier.

          7. Fluctuating Ocean and Land Temperatures
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Global weather patterns, including dry and wet conditions on land, are
          mostly determined by ocean temperatures, and even minor changes in
          temperature can have profound consequences on climate systems.
          According to research, extreme weather patterns on land, such as
          protracted droughts in North America and the eastern Mediterranean
          correspond directly to dramatic and prolonged temperature changes in
          the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans.
