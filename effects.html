        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Drought conditions often provide too little water to support food
          crops, through either natural precipitation or irrigation using
          reserve water supplies. The same problem affects grass and grain used
          to feed livestock and poultry. When drought undermines or destroys
          food sources, people go hungry. When the drought is severe and
          continues over a long period, famine may occur. Many of us remember
          the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, which was the result of a deadly
          combination of a severe drought and a dangerously ineffective
          government. Hundreds of thousands died as a result.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          All living things must have water to survive. People can live for
          weeks without food, but only a few days without water. In places like
          California, drought is experienced mainly as an inconvenience, perhaps
          with some economic losses, but in very poor countries the consequences
          are much more direct. When desperate for water to drink, people will
          turn to untreated sources that can make them sick.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Drought often creates a lack of clean water for drinking, public
          sanitation and personal hygiene, which can lead to a wide range of
          life-threatening diseases. The problem of water access is critical:
          every year, millions are sickened or die due to lack of clean water
          access and sanitation, and droughts only make the problem worse.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The low moisture and precipitation that often characterize droughts
          can quickly create hazardous conditions in forests and across
          rangelands, setting the stage for wildfires that may cause injuries or
          deaths as well as extensive property damage and already shrinking food
          supplies.<br /><br />

          With wild animals and plants suffering from droughts, even if they
          have adapted to dry conditions, they will die or invade human
          populations in search of water.<br /><br />

          Droughts will then result in increased mortality and reduced
          reproduction, which is especially problematic for populations of
          at-risk species whose numbers are already very low.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          When a precious commodity like water is in short supply due to
          drought, and the lack of water creates a corresponding lack of food,
          people will compete—and eventually fight and kill—to secure enough
          water to survive. Some believe that the current Syrian civil war
          ultimately started after 1.5 million rural Syrians fled the
          drought-stricken rural areas for the cities, triggering unrest.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Many areas in the world rely on hydroelectric projects for
          electricity. Drought will reduce the amount of water stored in
          reservoirs behind dams, reducing the amount of power produced. This
          problem can be very challenging for the numerous small communities
          relying on small-scale hydro, where a small electric turbine is
          installed on a local creek.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Droughts frequently have a negative financial impact on families,
          businesses, governments, and individuals. Low yields lead to a
          significant revenue loss and ultimately result in pay reductions and
          farm labor layoffs. Since farmers lack the funds to buy equipment,
          businesses and companies that make farm equipment may go out of
          business. Hydropower plants run at a reduced capacity when the water
          supply is low, which forces enterprises to pay more for electricity or
          suffer the expense of utilizing their own generators.
