        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Drought is shortly the unusual dryness of soil due to the levels of
          rainfall. Drought occurs when rainfall is significantly below average
          over a prolonged period. It is an event of shortages in the water
          supply, surface water, or groundwater. A drought can last for years,
          months or days. Shortage of water, Dry and hot winds, rise in
          temperature, and consequent evaporation of moisture from the ground
          contribute to conditions of drought. Droughts also result in crop
          failure too. Droughts have a major impact on the ecosystem and
          agriculture of the affected regions. Also, droughts harm the local
          economy of the region. Droughts are considered a natural disaster as
          it disturbs our whole ecosystem. Drought is considered as the
          recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world. These
          days regular droughts have become more extreme and more unpredictable
          because of climatic changes. Also, studies based on dendrochronology,
          confirm that the drought-affected by global warming goes back to 1900.
          Millennium Drought in Australia (1997–2009) is a well-known historical
          drought. The drought led to a water supply crisis across the country.
          As a result of it, many desalination plants were built for the first
          time. These plants are meant for the process of removing salt from
          seawater. The State of Texas in 2011, lived under a drought emergency
          declaration for the whole year. The state suffered severe economic
          losses. If ant time drought persists, the conditions surrounding the
          region gradually worsen and its impact on the local population
          gradually increases day by day.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Droughts caused due to meteorological factors are most common in
          nature and usually precede other types of droughts. Such an event is
          caused by a prolonged period of low precipitation. Dry weather
          patterns dominate the area experiencing a climatological drought. The
          severity of such droughts depends on the magnitude of the shortfall of
          precipitation, as well as the duration of the shortfall event.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          An agricultural drought occurs when crop growth in an area is
          adversely affected due to drought. Often, meteorological droughts lead
          to agricultural droughts. Low levels of precipitation over a sustained
          period of time can lead to crop failure. However, such droughts can
          also occur in the absence of changes in precipitation levels. Poor
          agricultural practices can occasionally lead to changes in soil
          conditions or soil erosion that will decrease the amount of water
          available to crops for proper growth. Agricultural droughts are more
          common in non-irrigated agricultural areas where a plant’s source of
          water is largely dependent on prevailing weather conditions.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
         
This type of drought occurs when the water reserves available to us fall below a significant threshold. These sources are that are aquifers, lakes and reservoirs fall. Hydrological drought tends to show up more slowly.
<br><br>

This slow pace of drought is because it involves stored water that is used but not replenished from sources. Like an agricultural drought, this can be triggered by more than just a loss of rainfall. For example, around 2007 Kazakhstan was given a large amount of money by the World Bank to restore water that had been diverted to other nations from the Aral Sea under Soviet rule.
